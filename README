----- TOOLS -----

1. SSI_Demo (Windows only): only accept "SSI over USB CDC" interface which is used in MSI Bus System software.

2. Zebre SDK C# Application: accept "SNAPI" (current default interface of scanner) and some other interfaces.

----- HOW TO SETUP NEW ZEBRA BARCODE SCANNER (USB INTERFACE) -----

To use brand new Zebra scanner with MSI Bus System,
please ensure scanner is running with "SSI over USB CDC" interface.

1. How to confirm the interface:
	Open "SSI_Demo":
		- Press "Request FW" button: confirm decoder is working in "SSI over USB CDC" interface.
		  => FW version should be returned.
		- Press "Pull trigger" button: confirm scanning engine is working.
		  => LED red light should be on.
	If scanner can not talk to "SSI_Demo" please try "Zebra SDK C# Application"

2. How to turn scanner into "SSI over USB CDC":
	Need to scan "SSI over USB CDC" barcode to re-setup module into suitable interface.
	Barcode can be found in "PL3307 DECODER INTEGRATION GUIDE", section 8-4, page 152.

	How to scan "SSI over USB CDC" barcode in this case: there are 2 options

		Option-1: use C# application in Zebra SDK (can be used in case of SNAPI)
			- C# Application should be able to find scanner in "SNAPI" mode.
			- Pull trigger (LED red light should be on).
			- Scan "SSI over USB CDC" barcode
			  (after scanning, C# App should NOT be able to detect this scanner).
			- Confirm "SSI over USB CDC" interface by using SSI_Demo (Request FW, Pull trigger).
			- Re-scan until success.

		Option-2: use special scanning mode after powering up (can be used in any cases described above).
			Scanner is able to scan any configuration barcode within first 2sec after being powered up
			There would be no feedback or reponse to confirm a successful scanning.
			Please use "SSI_Demo" or "Zebra SDK" to confirm desired interface.
			- Completely power off scanner (plugout cable).
			- Prepare "SSI over USB CDC" barcode.
			- Power on scanner (plugin cable).
			- Quickly scan barcode.
			- Re-scan until success.

----- TROUBLE SHOOTING -----

1. Zebra barcode accidentally stop working with MSI Bus System after being used.

Phenomenon:

	- No LED light on object appreance in front of scanner.
	- After reset, still no LED light on object appearance in front of scanner. 
	- Can be confirmed by using Zebra C# application in Zebra SDK.
	  If there is a scanner found in SNAPI interface, that is this case.
	  Or SSI_Demo application also does not show any response when "Request FW" or "Pull trigger".
	- Both "SSI_Demo" and "Zebra SDK" can not be able to detect scanner.

Reason:
	- It may accidentally resets to factory setting, SNAPI.
	- Or it may accidentally resets into CDC mode
	  (which could NOT be detected by either "SSI_Demo" or "Zebra SDK").

How to fix: please refer "HOW TO SETUP NEW ZEBRA BARCODE SCANNER (USB INTERFACE), section 2"
