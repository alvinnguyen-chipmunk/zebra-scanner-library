--- WAITING ---
1. Segmentation fault at mlfsBarcode_read: ln121: memcpy()

2. Change to state machine

3. Change to auto scan routine

5. Default Reset: Default host of USB interface is SNAPI, need to be SSI
  - Phenomenon: accidentally reset to default. Statistic until Sep 13:
  	+ Touch board (> 5 times)
	+ Suddenly power off (> 2 times)
	+ Software not good (maybe transmit while decoder running) (1 time)
  - Workaround:
  	Step-1: use Windows app to change to SSI
	Step-2: write custom default
	        (NOTE: need to implement in SW, current = scan barcode)
    => Feasibility check is OK
  - TODO: Modules also need to change from SNAPI -> SSI at least 1 time.
          RISK: factory reset is SNAPI and can not be changed by SW.

6. Implement multi-package reading

--- FINISHED ---

4. Bug: after a failed scan session, next session will be failed 100%
  - Phenomenon: dump data of previous session in input queue
  - Solution: flush out that data
  	+ Try-1: tcflush(scanner, TCIFLUSH);
	  => FAILED
	  => Update (Sep 14, 13:44): tcflush failed in mlsBarcode.c using
	     global 'scanner' variable. However, it's ok with local 'fd'
	     with ssi_utils functions.
	+ Try-2:
		...
		// Set to non-blocking read to flush out dump data
		devConf.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;
		tcsetattr();
		// Flush data
		read(scanner, dump, sizeof(dump));
		// Set to timeout blocking read
		devConf.c_cc[VTIME] = TIMEOUT_MSEC;
		tcsetattr();
  - Result: OK
